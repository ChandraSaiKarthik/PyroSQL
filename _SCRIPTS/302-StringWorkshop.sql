/*String searching and manipulation in SQL Server can be error-prone and tedious...unless you're armed with the techniques described in Robyn's string manipulation workbench, here newly revised with extra material from collaborator Phil Factor....
 
This "workbench" on string handling and manipulation in SQL Server is a companion to my previous one on dates and times. Rather than rehash what is readily available on SQL Server Books on Line, I've once again tried to provide a  starting point for your own experiments.
 
It is structured so it can be pasted in its entirety into the Query Analyser, SSMS or other GUI and the individual examples executed (and it is available, as an attachment to the article).
 
The main difficulty in dealing with Strings in SQL Server is that the techniques are rather open-ended. There are often a number of different ways to achieve the same end result. The String functions such as STUFF or REVERSE are of little use by themselves, but when used in conjunction with others, they become extremely useful. Other functions are there as 'legacy items' meaning that it is difficult to remove functions such as SOUNDEX as there are still a few die-hards still using them
 
As with the previous 'workbench', my advice is to download the .sql file (see the Code Download link to the right of the article title) open it up in SQL Server, and start experimenting!
 
Ideally, you'll also have Books online open in a browser, to provide supplementary and background information.
 
I've added a few questions at the end just so you can check on your  progress. Overall, I hope that this workbench illustrates how easy string handling is in SQL Server once the basic ideas are grasped.

*/
--you can, of course, select according to strings, or partial strings
SELECT line FROM #poem WHERE line LIKE 'I Was%'--'I Was' at
--the start of the line ('%' means 'any number 0-n of any character)
SELECT line FROM #poem WHERE line LIKE '%sam%'--'sam' anywhere
SELECT line FROM #poem WHERE line LIKE '%?%'--? anywhere
SELECT line FROM #poem WHERE line BETWEEN 'a' AND 'e'--returns
--all lines starting with a,b,c or d
SELECT line FROM #poem WHERE line < 'D' --returns one line
SELECT line FROM #poem WHERE ' '+line LIKE '% g_tsam%'
--here we want only words starting with g?tsam. the underscore
--character means 'one character, anything you like'. The leading
--space makes the logic simpler as it allows for occurences of the
--word at the beginning of the line
SELECT line FROM #poem WHERE ' '+line LIKE '%[aeiou][aeiou]%'
--any line with two consecutive vowels in it
--the '[]' delimiters contain a range of characters
--and mean 'one character, anything in the range'
--here, it is a list of vowels
SELECT line FROM #poem WHERE ' '+line LIKE '%[^a-z][aeiou][aeiou]%'
-- returns any line containing a word beginning with two vowels
--the [^a-z] will mean a whitespace character in European
--languages as long as you set your collation accordingly!
 
/*
The String Datatypes
SQL Server inherited from its Sybase ancestors a limit to the size of string. This complicated the manipulation of large quantities of  text. However, this limit has been remedied since SQL Server 2005 with the special datatype, Varchar(MAX). TEXT is now deprecated as a datatype but is used sufficiently in versions previous to SQL Server 2005 to make it relevant.
 
There are three basic string types (Unicode equivalents shown in brackets):
 
       Char (nChar)
       Varchar (nVarchar)
       Text (nText)
 
The nearest equivalents between the new 2005 string variables and  previous versions is as follows:
 
       XML -> nText
       Varchar(MAX) -> Text
       nVarchar(MAX) -> nText
 
(If replicating from a SQL Server 2005 publisher to a SQL Server 2000 subscriber, this mapping is done automatically but it's well to be
aware of what is going on).
Most European languages can be represented by the eight-bit character sets. For a 'global' system that can represent all languages, one
must opt for Unicode, and use NVarchar, or NChar or NText.  Peculiarly, the method of representing Unicode constants is case-sensitive, being the uppercase N prefix (N stands for National Language in the SQL-92 standard)*/
 
/*Unicode constants are interpreted as Unicode data, and are not evaluated using a code page. Unicode constants do have a collation, though, which determines comparisons and case sensitivity. Unicode data is stored using two bytes per character         */
SELECT DATALENGTH(N'This one is a unicode string'),
        DATALENGTH('This is not a unicode string')
/* ----------- -----------
   56          28
You'll see that the first string needed twice the storage of the second Unicode string constants support enhanced collations.
 
 
Strings and Collations
Collations determine the result of sorts, and string comparisons. Constants are assigned the default collation of the current database, unless the COLLATE clause is used to override it.

SELECT * FROM ::fn_helpcollations()
/*... which produces a list of many collations, including the following ...
 
Latin1_General_BIN

Latin1_General_CI_AI_KS

-- same
SELECT CASE WHEN 'A'<>'a' collate Latin1_General_CS_AI
               THEN 'Different' ELSE 'same' END
-- different
/*
The name of the collation can include the language, the country or region, and the case, accent, and width sensitivity. Windows collations that designate a country or region name in addition to the language name are usually distinct because they have different sort orders than other collations in the same language and map to a different code page.
So any function or stored procedure that is intended to be portable across databases must be explicit about collation where necessary. Collations can be selected at Server, Database, column or expression, but we'll only illustrate its selection in an expression.*/
/*
Some of the jargon and abbreviations used in the names for the collations require explanation
 
Binary BIN
    Binary is the fastest sorting order. It sorts and compares data based on the bit patterns defined for each character.
    Binary sort order is case-sensitive (lowercase precedes uppercase), and accent-sensitive.
     
    If one chooses a language-based sort rather than a binary sort, SQL Server follows sorting and comparison rules as defined in dictionaries for the associated language or alphabet.
 
Case-sensitive CS
    Case-sensitive collation means that the uppercase and  lowercase versions of letters are considered different.
     */

    /* 
Accent-sensitive AS
    Accent-Sensitive collation means that, For example, 'a' is not equal to 'ив'. and will sort strings so that strings beginning with a but with different accents, will not be sorted together*/

Width-sensitive WS
    specifies that a single-byte (half-width) 'hankaku' character and the same character represented as a double-byte (full-width)  'zenkaku' character are different Half-width characters has a glyph image that occupies half of the character display cell. 
 Assignment and Truncation
String variables work similarly to string data in tables except for the way SQL Server behaves if an attempt is made to assign a string that is longer than the variable's length.
 
One has to be very careful to watch out for truncation when assigning to string variables. Assigning to a string variable causes truncation without causing an error. This is done in order to achieve consistency with the behaviour of the CHAR datatype. */

One can even use it for awkward operations like deleting part of the string, as I will show later on in the article.
Slicing Strings Up: LEFT RIGHT and SUBSTRING
There are three functions that are generally used for slicing strings into substrings. These are LEFT, RIGHT and SUBSTRING. LEFT gives however many characters you specify from the left, or start, of the string and RIGHT gives however many characters you specify from the right, or end, of the string. SUBSTRING works like LEFT but allows you to specify the start position.
 
Here is another string-slicer based on using CHARINDEX, LEFT and STUFF which, likes the previous example, slices a series of delimited strings into a table.

Even if they worked in one language, which they don't, they aren't even internationally valid.

Manipulating TEXT and NTEXT
For the deprecated TEXT and NText datatype, there are a only a few functions that will work with them. These are PATINDEX, TEXTVALID, SUBSTRING, DATALENGTH and TEXTPTR As these are either covered elsewhere, or too esoteric to be within the scope of the workbench, I'd like to refer you to Book On Line, which covers them very well
 
Some questions
1/ What happens when you assign a string to a Varchar variable whose length is shorter then that of the string
 
2/ When replicating from a SQL 2005 publisher to a SQL 2000  subscriber, how is a nVarchar(MAX) mapped?
 
3/ How do you specify the sort order of strings?
 
4/ What is width-sensitivity in a collation?
 
5/ How would you, with one function, find the start of the first word in a string that starts with a lower case character.
 
6/ How might you go about decimal-aligning numbers in a fixed-width  font?
 
7/ How might one go about stripping all text in brackets from a  VARCHAR variable?
 
8/ What collation would be a good choice id you were writing a SQL Server Database that would be used in several European countries.
If you liked reading this workbench, then take a look ar Robyn Page and Phil Factor's subsequent series on string functions.
