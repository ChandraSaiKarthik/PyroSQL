* FREE
Free ram is ram that hasn't been allocated yet. 
Programs that aren't using ram keep it allocated for later because it's faster 
to reuse already allocated ram than free ram and reallocate it later. 
If a new process needs memory but the amount of free ram is low, 
some of the available memory will be deallocated.
