	Finally, let's go back to the users and ask questions:
	- Can the business operate if this server is down?
	- How many employees have to stop working if this server goes down?
	- Who should I call when the server goes down?
	- Is this server covered by any security or compliance regulations?
	We can use their answers to build a good backup & recovery solution.
	
	Is there anything you think should be added here?  You can edit this script!
	Go to the script's home page:
	http://sqlserverpedia.com/wiki/Audit_a_SQL_Server_Configuration
	Log into SQLServerPedia (it's free to create an account).  After you've
	logged in, you'll see an Edit button at the top of the page.  Click that,
	and you can edit this script right now to add your own contributions!
